# Tandoor Express
Tandoor Express Restaurant (Hypothetical)

The purpose of this website is to implement my knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript and basic PHP (File handling and Headers).

It doesn't require a server for DB.

The Orders of Customer is strored in the server(machine in which website is uploaded) as a text file named 'OrderIDs.txt'

The last entry is the Latest Entry in the order file.

I also developed an Algo for a Unique OrderID Generation using php.
